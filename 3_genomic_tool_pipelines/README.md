WARP (WDL Analysis Research Pipelines) repository is a collection of cloud-optimized pipelines for processing biological data from the Broad Institute Data Sciences Platform and collaborators.  

WARP pipelines provide robust, standardized data analysis for the Broad Institute Genomics Platform and large consortia like the Human Cell Atlas and the BRAIN Initiative. You can count on WARP for rigorously scientifically validated, high scale, reproducible and open source pipelines.
