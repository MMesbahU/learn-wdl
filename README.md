## What is WDL?
- The Workflow Description Language (WDL or 'widdle') is an open source scripting language which allows you to specify data processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. 

- WDL was originally developed for genomics, but can be extended to other domains. Learn more at the open WDL language website - [link](https://openwdl.org/)
- This repository contains educational materials for learning to read and write WDL scripts which can be executed on a variety of computing environments

## Execution Engines
WDL is not executable in and of itself, but requires an execution engine to run. Compliant executions engines should support the features of a specific version of the WDL specification. Please see the corresponding engine documentation for information on available execution options and support.

 - [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) - **IMPORTANT** This Repo uses `cromwell-50.jar` for testing all WDL example scripts
