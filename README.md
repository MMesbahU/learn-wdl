## What is WDL?
- The Workflow Description Language (WDL or 'widdle') is an open source scripting language which allows you to specify data processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. 

- WDL was originally developed for genomics, but can be extended to other domains. Learn more at the open WDL language website - [link](https://openwdl.org/)
- This repository contains educational materials for learning to read and write WDL scripts which can be executed on a variety of computing environments
- **IMPORTANT** This Repo uses `cromwell-50.jar` for testing all WDL example scripts
