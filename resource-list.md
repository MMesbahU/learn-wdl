# List of WDL Resources


OpenWDL on GitHub -- https://github.com/openwdl/wdl

Question - is there a WDL document style guide (or a general Broad Institute technical documentation style guide?)

---


From Geraldine's Book- Here are three docs that I think you might find useful for Terra documentation. We ended up rewriting them almost entirely with a different educational angle, so all the material is fair game for turning into docs.
 
1. WDL features:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bFTedhrlMT4kzQzeiY10S4dYGirqbhZ-TuJKljpKtA/edit
 
2. FISS API, for programmatic interaction with Terra:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Px1JKM4OfvqPZxo_VuuHO4TIbI6EbtPsAVmGuUA7yRc/edit#heading=h.4jihyewfql0r
 
3. Jupyter notebooks
